# PSoC&trade; 4: CY8CPROTO-040T demo

This code example demonstrates an implementation of a low-power application including recommended power states and transitions, tuning parameter adjustments, and the method of tuning. This example uses a self-capacitance-based button, a mutual-capacitance-based button, and a self-capacitance-based slider in multi sense CAPSENSE&trade; low-power (MSCLP - 5th-generation low-power CAPSENSE&trade;) to demonstrate different considerations to implement a low-power design.

## Operation

1. Connect the USB cable between the [CY8CPROTO-040T Kit](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CPROTO-040T) and the PC, as shown in **Figure 1**.

   **Figure 1. Connecting the CY8CPROTO-040T Kit with the PC**

   <img src="images/proto_kit.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="350"/>

2. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

3. After programming, the application starts automatically.

> **Note:** After programming, you will see the following error message if the Debug mode is disabled. This can be ignored, or enabling debug will solve this error.<br>

   ``` c
   "Error: Error connecting Dp: Cannot read IDR"
   ```

4. Touch any of the sensors with your finger; LEDs turn ON, indicating the activation of different CAPSENSE&trade; sensors.

   **Table 1. LED states for different sensors**

    Sensor touched | LED indication
   :---------------------| :-----
    CSD button  | LED 2 turns ON
    CSX button  | LED 2 turns ON
    CSD slider | LED 3 brightness changes based on touch position
    
    <br>

   Both LEDs will be OFF when none of the sensors are touched.

5. Verify that the application is transitioning to different power modes based on the user input conditions as follows:

   If there is no user activity for a certain time (ACTIVE_MODE_TIMEOUT_SEC = 10 s), the application transitions to Active-low Refresh rate (ALR) mode. Here, the refresh rate is reduced to 32 Hz.
   
   Further non-activity for a certain time (ALR_MODE_TIMEOUT_SEC = 5 s) transitions the application to the lowest-power mode, called the Wake-on-Touch (WoT) mode, which scans the low-power widget at a low refresh rate (16 Hz).

   **Figure 2. Low-power mode state machine**

    <img src="images/capsense_lp_firmware_state_machine.png" alt="Figure 2" width="350"/>

### Monitor data using CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner


1. Open the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner from the **Tools** section in the IDE Quick Panel.

   You can also run the CAPSENSE&trade; tuner application standalone from *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/ModusToolbox/tools_{version}/capsense-configurator/capsense-tuner*. In this case, after opening the application, select **File** > **Open** and then open the *design.cycapsense* file of the respective application, which is present in the *{Application root directory}/bsps/TARGET_APP_\<BSP-NAME>/config* folder.

   See the [ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*) for options to open the CAPSENSE&trade; tuner application using the CLI.

2. Ensure that the status LED is ON and not blinking; this indicates that the onboard KitProg3 is in CMSIS-DAP Bulk mode. See the [Firmware-loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) to learn how to update the firmware and switch modes in KitProg3.

3. In the tuner application, click on the **Tuner Communication Setup** icon or select **Tools** > **Tuner Communication Setup** as shown in **Figure 3**.

   **Figure 3. Tuner communication setup**

   <img src="images/tuner-comm-setup.png" alt="Figure 3" width="300" /> 

   Select I2C under KitProg3 and configure it as follows:

   - I2C address: 8
   - Sub-address: 2 bytes
   - Speed (kHz): 400

   These are the same values set in the EZI2C resource as shown in **Figure 4**.

   **Figure 4. Tuner Communication Setup parameters**

   <img src="images/tuner-comm-settings.png" alt="Figure 4" width="450"/>

4. Click **Connect** or select **Communication** > **Connect** to establish a connection.

   **Figure 5. Establish connection**

   <img src="images/tuner-connect.png" alt="Figure 5" width="300" />

5. Click **Start** or select **Communication** > **Start** to begin data streaming from the device.

   **Figure 6. Start Tuner communication**

   <img src="images/tuner-start.png" alt="Figure 6" width="300" />

   The **Widget/Sensor Parameters** tab is updated with the parameters configured in the *CAPSENSE&trade; Configurator* window. The tuner displays the data from the sensor in the **Widget View** and **Graph View** tabs.

6. Set the **Read mode** to **Synchronized mode**. Navigate to the **Widget view** tab and notice that the touched widget is highlighted in **blue** as shown in **Figure 7**.

   **Figure 7. Widget view of the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner**

   <img src="images/tuner-widget-view.png" alt="Figure 7" width=""/>

7. Go to the **Graph View** tab to view the raw count, baseline, difference count, and status of each sensor.
To view the sensor data for the buttons, select Button_Sns0 or Button1_Rx0 under Button0 and Button1, respectively (see **Figure 8** and **Figure 9**). To view the slider sensor data, select LinearSlider0_Sns0 under LinearSlider0 (see **Figure 10**).

   <img src="images/graph-view-wot.png" alt="Figure 11" width="650"/>

9. The tuning procedure, using the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner for specific widgets is explained in the corresponding code examples mentioned in the [Tuning parameters](#tuning-parameters) section. 

**Note :** Refer to the [PSoC&trade; 4: MSCLP low-power CSD button](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc4-msclp-low-power-csd-button) to observe the power state transitions, indicated by changing the blinking rate of a LED.
The Code Example also explains the scan time and process time measurements.
 
## Operation at other voltages

[CY8CPROTO-040T Kit](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CPROTO-040T) supports operating voltages of 1.8 V, 3.3 V and 5 V. See the [Kit user guide](https://www.infineon.com/002-38600) to set the preferred operating voltage and refer to the section [Setup the VDDA supply voltage and Debug mode](#set-up-the-vdda-supply-voltage-and-debug-mode-in-device-configurator).

The functionalities of this application is optimally tuned for 5 V. Observe that the basic functionalities work across other voltages.

For better performance, it is recommended to tune the application to use the preferred voltages. 

## Measure current at different power modes

1. Disable the run-time measurement, serial LED, and tuner macros to measure the current used for CAPSENSE&trade; sensing in each power mode in *main.c*, and disable the self-test library from the CAPSENSE&trade; configurator as follows:

   ```
      #define ENABLE_RUN_TIME_MEASUREMENT      (0u)
      
      #define ENABLE_PWM_LED                   (0u)

      #define ENABLE_TUNER                     (0u)
    ```
    
2. Disable the self-test library from the CAPSENSE&trade; configurator as shown in **Figure 12**.

   **Figure 12. Disable self-test library**

   <img src="images/self-test-disable.png" alt="Figure 12" width="600"/>

3.  Disable the Debug mode (if enabled). By default, it is disabled. See [Setup the VDDA supply voltage and debug mode](#set-up-the-vdda-supply-voltage-and-debug-mode-in-device-configurator) to enable. Enabling Debug mode keeps the SWD pins active in all device power modes and even during Deep Sleep. This leads to increase in power consumption.

4.  To evaluate the low-power feature of the device, connect the kit to a Power Analyzer (for example, KEYSIGHT - N6705C) using a current measure header, as shown in **Figure 13**.

    **Figure 13. Power analyzer connection**

    <img src="images/ammeter-setup.png" alt="Figure 13" width="600"/>

5. Use "Keysight BenchVue Advanced Power Control and Analysis" software to control the power analyzer device through the PC.

6. Select the **Current Measure** option from the Instrument Control setup. Select and turn ON the output channel, as shown in **Figure 14**.

   **Figure 14. Current measurement setup**

   <img src="images/current_measurement_setup.png" alt="Figure 14" width="300"/>

7. Capture the data using the **Data logger** option from the tool. The average current consumption is measured using cursors on each power mode, as shown in **Figure 15**.

   **Figure 15. Current measurement**

   <img src="images/power_measurement.png" alt="Figure 15" width="850"/>

8. After reset, the application transitions to a low-power state if there is no button touch detection, in order to reduce power consumption, as shown in  **Figure 16**.

   **Figure 16. Power mode transition - no user activity**
   
   <img src="images/power-transitions.png" alt="Figure 16" width="550"/>

9. If there is touch detection while in low-power state, the application transitions to Active mode with the highest refresh rate as shown in **Table 2**.


   **Table 2. Measured current for different modes**

    Power mode   |Refresh rate (Hz) | Current consumption (µA)
   :--------------------------|:-----:|:-----:
    Active    |128 |148
    Active-low refresh rate <br>(ALR)|32 |39
    Wake-on-Touch <br>(WoT)|16 |3.9
    
    <br>
    
> **Note :** The earlier WoT current was measured on a kit with 1.7 µA Deep Sleep current. If the kit has a Deep Sleep current of 2.5 µA (typical), the WoT current is expected to be ~4.7 µA.


## Tuning procedure

<details><summary><b>Create custom BSP for your board</b></summary>

1. Follow the steps shown in [ModusToolbox&trade; BSP Assistant user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-ModusToolbox_BSP_Assistant_1.0_User_Guide-UserManual-v02_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c8386267f0183a972f45c59af) to create a custom BSP for your board having any device. In this code example, it is created for the **CY8C4046LQI-T452** device.

2. Open the *design.modus* file from *{Application root directory}/bsps/TARGET_APP_\<BSP-NAME>/config* folder obtained in the previous step and enable CAPSENSE&trade; to get the *design.cycapsense* file. CAPSENSE&trade; configuration can then be started from scratch as follows.
</details>

## Design and implementation

The design has a ratiometric implementation of the following sensors:
1. One Wake-on-Touch widget (2 elements), also called "Low-power Widget"
2. One self-capacitance button widget (1 element)
3. One mutual-capacitance button widget (2 elements)
4. One slider widget (5 elements)

Following are the two LEDs used in this project: 
- LED 2 shows the button touch status: It turns ON when touched and turns OFF when the finger is lifted. 
- LED 3 shows the slider touch status: It's brightness changes based on the finger touch position.

There are three power states defined for this project:

- Active mode

- Active-low refresh rate (**ALR**) mode

- Wake-on-Touch (**WoT**) mode

After reset, the device is in Active mode, and scans the regular CAPSENSE&trade; widgets with a high refresh rate (**128 Hz**). If user activity is detected in any other mode, the device is transferred to Active mode to provide the best user interface experience. This mode has the highest power consumption; therefore, the design should reduce the time spent in Active mode.

If there is no user activity for a certain period of time (`ACTIVE_MODE_TIMEOUT_SEC` = 10 s), the application transitions to ALR mode. Here, the refresh rate is reduced to **32 Hz**; and hence this mode acts as an intermediate state before moving to the lowest-power mode (WoT mode). This mode can also be used for periodically updating the baselines of sensors while there is no user activity for a long time.

Further non-activity for a certain time span (`ALR_MODE_TIMEOUT_SEC` = 5 s) transitions the application to the lowest-power mode, called the **Wake-on-Touch** mode, which scans the low-power widget at a low refresh rate (**16 Hz**) and processes the results without CPU intervention.

> **Note:** An internal low-power timer (MSCLP timer) is available in CAPSENSE&trade; MSCLP hardware to set the refresh rate for each power mode as follows:

- For Active and ALR modes: Use the `Cy_CapSense_ConfigureMsclpTimer()` function
- For WoT mode: Use the Wake-on-Touch scan interval in CAPSENSE&trade; configurator

Different power modes and transition conditions for a typical use case are shown in **Figure 18**.

   **Figure 18. State machine showing different power states of the device**

   <img src="images/capsense_lp_firmware_state_machine.png" alt="Figure 18" width="350"/>


The project uses the [CAPSENSE&trade; middleware](https://github.com/Infineon/capsense) (see ModusToolbox&trade; user guide for more details on selecting a middleware). See [AN85951 – PSoC&trade; 4 design guide](https://www.infineon.com/AN85951) for more details on CAPSENSE&trade; features and usage.

The [ModusToolbox&trade;](https://www.infineon.com/modustoolbox) provides a GUI-based tuner application for debugging and tuning the CAPSENSE&trade; system. The CAPSENSE&trade; tuner application works with EZI2C and UART communication interfaces. This project has an SCB block configured in EZI2C mode to establish communication with the onboard KitProg, which in turn enables reading the CAPSENSE&trade; raw data using the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner. See [EZI2C Peripheral settings](#resources-and-settings).

The CAPSENSE&trade; data structure that contains the CAPSENSE&trade; raw data is exposed to the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner by setting up the I2C communication data buffer with the CAPSENSE&trade; data structure. This enables the tuner to access the CAPSENSE&trade; raw data for tuning and debugging CAPSENSE&trade;.


### Set up the VDDA supply voltage and Debug mode in Device Configurator
